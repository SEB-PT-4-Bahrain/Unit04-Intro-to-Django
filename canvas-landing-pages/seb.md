## About

In this module, you will explore Django, a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Designed to make it easier to build complex, data-driven websites, Django handles much of the hassle of web development so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

Throughout this module, you will learn about Django's unique architecture, which uses a Model-View-Template (MVT) design.
